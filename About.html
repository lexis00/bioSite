    <h1>About Akeem </h1>
        <p>Akeem Williams is a twenty-five-year-old male from Miami, Florida.  Being the younger brother of two brothers shaped a lot of his upcoming. Throughout his life, he was able to learn from the successes and mistakes of others.  A significant role model in Akeem’s life is his uncle, whose name he is uncomfortable with me disclosing. What Akeem admires most about his uncle is his discipline.  </p>
        <p>Discipline is one of Akeem’s most admired attributes. His discipline was very beneficial to the United States Air Force. He served six years in the Air Force and deployed twice. During his deployment, he received many medals for his bravery and leadership. However, discipline and bravery are not the only assets he brought to the service; he also brought compassion. </p>
        <p>Compassion, integrity, and family are Akeem’s core values. These are values he wished the world shared. Nonetheless, he continues to leave the judgment to God and be the best human he knows how to be. </p>
        <p>If you are curious about what Akeem is up to now, he is still compassionate and helping others. He no longer serves in the military but works very closely with the United States Air Force as a government contractor; his occupation now requires him to fix and maintain computer systems and software. 
        Akeem is not a big dreamer; he is more of a realist. However, if he had one dream for the world, it would be for individuals to be less selfish and more united. </p>
